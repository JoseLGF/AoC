# AoC
My solutions to the Advent Of Code event.

## Run the 2020 Python solutions
Run the following command in a Windows Command Line:
```
./2020/Python/RunAllDays.bat
```

## Run the 2021 C++ solutions
The 2021 AOC are written in C++ in Linux, so just `make` and run the executable:
```
$ cd src/
$ make
$ cd ..
$ ./aoc2021
```
## Run the 2022 Rust solutions
The 2022 AoC solutions are written in Rust in Linux. They can be run by cding into the 2022 directory and running cargo:
```
$ cd 2022
$ cargo run
```
